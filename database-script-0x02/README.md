So what I've done in ![seed-code](/database-script-0x02/seed.sql) is to populate my database with sample data.

In order to do this, I have used the following database sql features:

- **INSERT**: A data manipulation syntax that is used to add new rows of data to the table.
- **SELECT**: This is also a manipulation syntax used to retrieve data from a specified column
- **WHERE**: This is used to filter a row based on certain specified conditions
- **FROM**: This is used to specify a particular table from which queries are to be directed to
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column which it is ascribed to is not empty. It means input is required
- **--Comment**: Used to pass comment or comment out a specific line
